# Candy Crush ++

Candy Crush clone in C++ using the GUI library [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) and making use of common Object Oriented (OO) patterns.
The game was built as part of the yearly project for the course *Programming Languages II* given by Prof. John Iacono
at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) during the 2021-2022 academic year. The course was mainly focused on modern techniques in C++ and on OO concepts.

The final version includes many kinds of candies (row and colum clear, neighborhood clear, same color clear), animations, suggestions of potential moves,
and various levels with different objectives. A peek at these features can be seen below.

## Build & Run

The only dependencies are `gcc`, `make` and `fltk`. Then one simply has to:

```shell
# Build the project
make
```

And then run the produced `main.out` executable.
